# DirectX Raytracing

This repository contains the source code of my DirectX Raytracing research project at [DAE Research](https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/133/Research).

The project was started from the [Microsoft DirectX-Graphics-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples).

The projects I worked on are [MiniEngine/AdaptiveSampling](https://github.com/SeppahBaws/DirectX-Raytracing/tree/main/MiniEngine/AdaptiveSampling) and [MiniEngine/RayBinning](https://github.com/SeppahBaws/DirectX-Raytracing/tree/main/MiniEngine/RayBinning).

An in-depth explanation on the Adaptive Sampling project can be found on my portfolio entry: [https://seppedekeyser.be/projects/directx-raytracing](https://seppedekeyser.be/projects/directx-raytracing).

## Cloning this repo

Since some models used for benchmarking are very large, they are distributed as a zip folder under the [releases tab](https://github.com/SeppahBaws/DirectX-Raytracing/releases).

Simply download the zip folder in the latest release, and extract the assets in the following locations:

| folder in zip file     | extract contents to repo directory               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| AdaptiveSampling/*     | MiniEngine/AdaptiveSampling/Models/*             |
| ModelConverter_Clean/* | MiniEngine/ModelConverter_Clean/ModelConverter/* |
| RayBinning/*           | MiniEngine/RayBinning/Models/*                   |

## Footnotes

Big thanks to the entire [DAE Research](https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/133/Research) team for giving me the opportunity to do my internship with them, and especially my mentor: [Matthieu Delaere](https://www.matthieudelaere.com/).
