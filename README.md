# DirectX Raytracing

This repository contains the source code of my DirectX Raytracing research project at [DAE Research](https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/133/Research).

The project was started from the [Microsoft DirectX-Graphics-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples).

The projects I worked on are MiniEngine/RayBinning and MiniEngine/AdaptiveSampling.

An in-depth explanation on the Adaptive Sampling project can be found on my portfolio entry: [https://seppedekeyser.be/projects/directx-raytracing](https://seppedekeyser.be/projects/directx-raytracing).

## Cloning this repo

Since some models used for benchmarking are very large, Git LFS is used.

Check if you have Git LFS installed before cloning this repo:
```
$ git lfs install
> Git LFS initialized.
```
